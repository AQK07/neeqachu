  <p> Hi neeqah, hi my love. This is unexpected i know but, i've just had so much on my mind about you. Ever since i met you, my life has gotten so much better, you've really made everything so much better. You've made me who i am today, and i'm proud of the man i have become. Your love, your care, your support and most of all, you. Have changed my whole life. I used to think i had no reason to be on this earth, but then i found you. I was made to love you, to care for you, and to be your shoulder during hard times. You are my complementary piece, and i feel that i am yours. We complete each other. I love everything about you meri neeqah jaan, your smile is as warm as the sun, your eyes shine like the night sky stars, your laughter lights fireworks within my heart, your happiness is my life's purpose, and your love is a blanket of warmth in an endless freezing winter. You are my biggest blessing aneeqah. In this world, we have found each other. I couldn't be more thankful. I found my girl. I found my wife. I'm so lucky to be the one you love. Thank you for everything you do for me. One day i hope to give you the universe. I love you. - aapka shohar, qasim.  </p>
